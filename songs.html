There's a fire starting in my heart<br>
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark<br>
Finally, I can see you crystal clear<br>
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare<br>
See how I'll leave with every piece of you<br>
Don't underestimate the things that I will do<br>
There's a fire starting in my heart<br>
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark<br>

The <b>scars</b> of your love remind me of us<br>
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all<br>
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless<br>

<font color = "magenta" face = "arial"
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br>
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br>
